From the website where this is deployed, http://wedontmakedemands.org:

> The #Occupy movement has frequently been accused, in media coverage, of not having a clearly articulated demand for the outcome of the protests.
> 
> Participants come to the movement for many reasons, prompted by deep frustration with the corruption, fraud, corporate crime, and obstructed democratic process that are endemic to US and global politics.
> 
> We don't think any of these individual ideas will solve everyone's problems. We just want real, meaningful change.
> 
> These posters were designed by participants at the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York City. They are in the public domain. You are welcome to print them out and post them in your own location. You're also invited to make your own.
> 
> We don't make demands. Here are some suggestions.

The git repository was set up to support development of the Create feature of the site. This page is an entirely client-side webapp that allows people to create and share their own messages for wide dissemination.

Try it out: Just fill in different text, link to a different Wikipedia article, and you now have a new poster you can link to and send around.

Enjoy.
