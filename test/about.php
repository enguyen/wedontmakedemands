<p>The #Occupy movement has frequently been accused, in media coverage, of not having a clearly articulated demand for the outcome of the protests.</p>
<p>Participants come to the movement for many reasons, prompted by deep frustration with the corruption, fraud, corporate crime, and obstructed democratic process that are endemic to US and global politics.</p>
